## Architecture Guidelines

### Multi-Platform Architecture

- **Desktop**: Electron app with main/renderer processes, using Vite for both
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo, shared UI components with web
- **Web/SSR**: Next.js-style SSR application for server-side rendering
- **Shared Logic**: Common business logic in `packages/internal/`

### State Management

- **Jotai** for atomic state management across all platforms
- **Zustand** for complex state stores (in `packages/internal/store/`)
- **React Query** for server state management

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling across all platforms
- Platform-specific Tailwind configs in each app
- Shared Tailwind utilities in `packages/configs/tailwindcss/`

For desktop, see @apps/desktop/CLAUDE.md
For mobile, see @apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md

### Internationalization

- **i18next** for internationalization
- Locale files in `locales/` directory organized by feature
- Custom ESLint rules for i18n validation

#### i18n Writing Guidelines

1. Follow [i18next formatting guidelines](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/formatting)
2. **Use flat keys only** - Use `.` notation for separation, no nested objects
3. For plural-sensitive languages, use `_one` and `_other` suffixes
4. **Avoid conflicting flat keys** - During build, flat dot-separated keys (e.g., 'exif.custom.rendered.custom') are automatically converted to nested objects, which can cause conflicts. For example, 'exif.custom.rendered.custom' conflicts with 'exif.custom.rendered'. Avoid such patterns.
5. **Never use `defaultValue` in translations** - Always add proper translations to all three required language files: `en.json`, `zh-CN.json`, and `ja.json` in the appropriate feature directories under `locales/`

Example:

```json
{
  "personalize.title": "Personalization",
  "personalize.prompt.label": "Personal Prompt",
  "shortcuts.add": "Add Shortcut",
  "shortcuts.validation.required": "Name and prompt are required"
}
```

## Code Organization Patterns

### Import Conventions

- Use `pathe` instead of `node:path` for cross-platform compatibility
- Shared utilities should be imported from `packages/internal/`
- Platform-specific code should be clearly separated

### Component Structure

- Shared UI components in `packages/internal/components/`
- Platform-specific components in respective app directories
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- **Detailed guidelines**: See @packages/internal/CLAUDE.md for component development patterns

### Error Handling

- Custom error parsing utilities in `packages/internal/utils/`
- Sentry integration for error reporting across platforms

## Testing Strategy

- Vitest for unit testing across packages
- Platform-specific test configurations
- Test files co-located with source code

## Key Dependencies

- **Build**: Vite, Turbo, pnpm workspaces
- **Frontend**: React 19, Electron, React Native, Expo
- **State**: Jotai, Zustand, TanStack Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, SQLite
- **Utils**: Day.js, Zod, i18next

## Specialized Agent Usage Guidelines

Claude Code has access to specialized agents for different development tasks. **Always use the most appropriate agent** based on the task requirements:

### üß≠ **tech-lead-orchestrator** (Project Management & Quality)

**Use when:**

- Coordinating complex features across multiple components/platforms
- Conducting project quality assessments and code reviews
- Planning large refactoring efforts or architectural changes
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Managing cross-platform consistency and standards

**Examples:** "Implement RSS feed management system", "Review codebase quality", "Plan state management refactor"

### ‚öõÔ∏è **react-architect** (React Architecture & Performance)

**Use when:**

- Optimizing React component performance and re-rendering issues

**Use when:**

- Working with RSS/Atom feed parsing and processing
- Enhancing content extraction and readability
- Implementing content sanitization and security
- Optimizing feed discovery and update mechanisms
- Processing different content types (articles, podcasts, media)

**Examples:** "Fix RSS parsing issues", "Improve article extraction", "Add new feed format support"

### üóÑÔ∏è **data-architect** (Database & Data Management)

**Use when:**

- Fixing flaky tests and improving test reliability
- Creating testing utilities and mock strategies

**Examples:** "Add tests for AI chat feature", "Fix failing test suite", "Improve test coverage"

### üéØ **Agent Selection Guidelines**

**For multi-domain tasks**, start with **tech-lead-orchestrator** to coordinate other agents.

**Common combinations:**

- New feature: `tech-lead-orchestrator` ‚Üí `ui-design-engineer` + `data-architect` + `test-engineer`
- Performance issues: `performance-specialist` + `react-architect`
- Content problems: `content-processing-expert` + `data-architect`
- Cross-platform features: `platform-integration-specialist` + `tech-lead-orchestrator`

**Always specify the agent explicitly** when the task matches their domain expertise.

## Agent Usage Notes

- **Primary web app is at `apps/desktop/layer/renderer`** - A Vite + React SPA, not full Electron features
- **SSR app is minimal** - Only for external sharing pages, not main development focus
- **Mobile app** - React Native with Expo for iOS/Android
- **Always use Task tool with appropriate agent** - Don't implement complex features directly, delegate to specialized agents
